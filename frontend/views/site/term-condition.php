        <h3>Conditions of Use</h3>
        <p><a href="http://developer.ean.com/terms/en/">EAN Affiliate Program Agreement  </a></p>
        <p> Welcome to our mobile application! CrewFacts.com is the personnel travel app for CrewFacilities.com.    We provide our services to you subject to the following conditions.  If you use our application, you accept these conditions. Please read them carefully.Â </p>
        <p>
            Please review our Privacy Policy, which also governs your use of our application, to understand our practices.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you use a CrewFacilities.com and CrewFacts.com Mobile App, we collect and use information about you in the same way and for the same purposes as we do when you use our website.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Mobile App also sends us your device's unique device identifier (or "UID"), a sequence of numbers or characters that are distinctive to your mobile device. We use this only on the first opening of the Mobile App so we may confirm to our advertising networks, the number of downloads resulting from clicks on their respective ad banners and other marketing tools.  Each Mobile App will also send us error reporting information in the event that it crashes or hangs. This enables us to investigate the error and to improve the stability of the Mobile App for future releases. As part of these error reports, the Mobile App sends us information about the version and type of mobile device, the UID, time the error occurred, feature(s) being used and the state of the application when the error occurred. We do not use this information for any purpose other than investigating and remedying the error.  At any time, you may remove the Mobile App from your mobile device entirely and access our services through our website at CrewFacilities.com and click ROOM REQUEST.
